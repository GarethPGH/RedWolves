                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>The largest of wild canines, the wolf once spread across the entire Northern Hemisphere, from the polar North to as far south as the tip of India. Wolves are highly variable in appearance and can be any range of colors or markings, although certain subspecies share similar characteristics. Despite being known for their brown and gray coats, as many as 30-40% of North American wolves are black who fade to white as they age. Arctic wolves are smaller and stockier than their southern cousins and sport an almost pure white coat. Eurasian and European wolves tend to be darker than their North American cousins and their coat is often tinged with a rusty red. Populations of wolves who live in the Middle Eastern desert areas tend to have short coats with large ears to radiate heat and regulate their body temperature. However, all wolves are known for their large jaws and piercing eyes, as well as their signature long-held howl. Despite often being very large, with some individuals living in the tundra near 160lbs, wolves are streamlined and build for distance running, with bodies more similar in appearance under their often 6-8 inch thick fur, to that of German shepherds, with deep chests like those of the greyhound.</p>

                        <p>Wolves are pack oriented and depend on each other for survival. A lone wolf will not stay lone for long. Although it was once believed that packs were strictly hierarchical in nature, with one or two wolves seeming to dominate the others, it has been discovered that wild packs are often made up of direct family members. They usually consist of parents and their offspring, and that the dominance interactions seen with captive packs made up of unrelated individuals, are often parenting interactions and not entirely tied to the idea of status. These interactions are highly ritualized, with the dominant wolf showing a reserved almost mock aggression and the submissive wolf will often respond as if still a puppy. Although dominance fights in captive packs can and do lead to injuries, in wild packs, this is rare. Wolves usually move out of their birth pack to find a mate to start a new pack with. Sometimes they will try to join established packs, however, outsider wolves are often forced out of other packs territories and must wander between established scent corridors that separate packs from each other.</p>

                        <h3>Recovery Efforts</h3>
                        <p>Wolves have always had a tenuous relationship with humans. Although primitive man saw the value in the wolf as a protector, hunting companion, and at times, survival food, once humans turned to agriculture, their attitudes towards the canine soured. Wolves have been almost exterminated throughout most of their range, with the last healthy populations remaining in the tundra and arctic environments where humans are rare.</p>

                        <p>In the US, there are recovery plans for wolves and populations have gone up since their extermination.</p>

                        <p>In 1995, wolves were brought from Canada to restore the ecological balance to Yellowstone National Park. Through stringent laws and punishments for poaching wolves, as well as incentive programs for ranchers to protect herds and reimburse losses, the population climbed, although their return to the Midwestern United States was not welcomed with open arms. In present years the wolf has been removed from the Endangered Species List in those specific states. Yearly, regulated wolf hunts have been reinstated in some areas.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile wolves from Canada have successfully re-established themselves to the northeastern territories in Maine. Despite wolves being protected by law, there are no plans to return them to the lower portions of their historical range.</p>

                        <p>Four wolves from a distinct subspecies from Arizona/Mexico were brought into captivity to reintroduce these populations to healthy levels. However the return of the Mexican gray wolf, called El Lobo, has been fraught with difficulty. Populations reached their highest with somewhere in the neighborhood of 53 individuals. Just over 30 now exist in the wild and most Mexican gray wolf deaths are caused by illegal killings.</p>

                        <p>Like the red wolf, the Mexican wolf may become threatened, not by angry ranchers or eager poachers, but by law: Congressional approval has been given to do genetic testing on the beleaguered population of wolves to determine their genetic purity. If these populations are found to be hybridized in nature with dogs or coyotes, a likely possibility due to historical population decline, the recovery program may be canceled in an effort to can funding.</p>

                        <p>Wolf populations in Europe, the Middle East, India and China are highly vulnerable to extinction due to negative views of the species. In some countries, there are only a couple dozen individuals still in existence.</p>

                        <p>Wolves in Japan are extinct.</p>

                        <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
                        <p>There is a group of wolves off the coast of Canada who were discovered that swim from island to island and eat seafood almost exclusively.</p>

                        <p>The wolves on Isle Royale were used for years as a population observation experiment due to the fact that the only thing on the island they could hunt were moose. When moose numbers soared, wolves had more pups. Less moose meant less pups. However, the extreme genetic isolation of the wolves on that island led to a severe case of inbreeding depression and the population has all but collapsed.</p>

                        <p>There is another highly endangered species of canine called the Ethiopian wolf that is closely related to the gray wolf. It sports an orange and white coat, with a distinct black and white patterned tail.</p>

                        <p>The golden jackal has been reclassified as a wolf due to genetic evidence suggesting that they are more closely related to wolves than jackals.</p>

                        <p>Wolves gave rise to domestic dogs, due to the fact that curious, human tolerant wolves were drawn towards ancient humans who cooked their food over open fire. The friendliest of these wolves puppies were taken in and bred together. A Russian experiment with foxes proved that breeding for friendliness is how dogs came to be. The experimental population began to show traits such as curly tails, spotted coats and floppy ears just like dogs.</p>

                        <p>Coyotes, wolves, jackals and dogs can breed together and produce viable offspring, despite being different species.</p>

                        <p>A separate species of “wild canine” exists in the United States called the Carolina Dog. They are believed to be direct descendants from the original dogs kept by the Native Americans. Despite being directly descended from wolves, Carolina dogs are often killed by wolves, and will go out of their way to avoid them. Unlike wolves, who dig simple dens with a single chamber, Carolina dog mothers dig elaborate branching dens, believed to mislead would-be predators or competitors. This rare breed of dog has been successfully reintroduced as a pet breed, although the wild dogs avoid humans.</p>

                        <p>The red wolf is a medium-sized canine with reddish-brown fur. Almost all red wolves share the same characteristic coat pattern and markings; white spots above eyes, thickly marked face and red-black mottled fur down the back and tail with a black tip at the end. All red wolves have a thick muzzle and small almond-shaped eyes, that are usually orange/yellow in color, similar to those of the gray wolf.</p>

                        <p>Red wolves behave very similarly to wolves. They form closely knit packs and rely on each other for survival.</p>

                        <p>Red wolves were believed to be the original wolf that roamed the United States, until recent genetic evidence suggested that they originated from early hybridization between coyotes and the gray wolves that originally inhabited the southeastern United States. It is suggested that Florida black wolves, now extinct, were actually red wolves, who lived in the, at the time, swampy state.</p>

                        <h3 class="Info RecoveryEfforts">RecoveryEfforts</h3>

                        <p>Red wolves were originally considered their own species. Twelve red wolves were taken into captivity to increase the species numbers before it was exterminated. No known wild populations existed in other places at the time they were brought into captivity, and these twelve are credited with being the reason the species exists today. Red wolf populations in captivity soared to somewhere around 250 individuals spread across several AZA zoos and breeding compounds. They were successfully reintroduced to Alligator River National Park in North Carolina. Wild populations reached about 50 individuals, through the cooperation of law enforcement and public relations campaigns to improve the attitudes of people towards the canines. However, this could have been all for naught.</p>

                        <h3 class="Info FascinatingFacts">FascinatingFacts</h3>

                        <p>Red wolves would not exist in the wild today without human intervention.</p>

                        <p>Eurasian wolves often display coats similar in color to red wolves despite being geographically separated.</p>

                        <p>Red wolves were originally believed to have diverged from the Dire wolf, the ice age ancestor of modern wolves, earlier than the gray wolf. It was also believed that the red wolf may have been the ancestor species of both gray wolves and coyotes.</p>

                        <h3 class="Info Hybrids">Species or Hybrids?</h3>

                        <p>Recent genetic evidence suggests that red wolves are actually coyote/wolf hybrids. The USFWS proposed dropping protections for red wolves because the Endangered Species Act does not take into account any hybrid populations, and hybrid populations are often seen as dangerous towards the survival plan of threatened species.</p>

                        <p> The question is when did the hybridization occur? It is entirely possible that wolves bred with coyotes as wolf populations were killed off and coyotes moved east to replace them.</p>

                        <p>Conservationists argue that the smaller-sized red wolves are more suited for living in the Southeastern United States and point to the fact that their hybridization may have occurred before European settlers entered the United States. Thus, there is a chance that they were already an established species, at the time that wolves were being eliminated from the US. As stated above, some populations of wolves that were described as endemic to the area may have, in fact, been red wolves, not gray wolves, as they were all described as being smaller than wolves found in the plains regions.</p>

                        <p>Genetic studies of the Algonquin wolf or Eastern wolf, a disputed subspecies of gray wolf, has revealed that it also is a hybrid and has similar genetic markers to the red wolf, despite being distinctly different in appearance. Some argue that this makes both populations distinct enough to require protection, due to the fact they may become their own species, and may provide interesting observations of genetic changes due to geographic isolation.</p>

                        <p>The possibility of hybridization may be used to threaten the recovery efforts of the Mexican gray wolf, as Congress has approved genetic studies to determine the purity of the critically endangered population.</p>

                        <p>Red wolf howls sound very similar to gray wolf howls.</p>

                        <p>This highly adaptable canine is the smallest of the three large canines in the United States. Originally from the southwest, the coyote is characterized by its tan-yellow fur that often appears silvered in winter. Both white and black coat variants of coyote exist but are rare. Coyotes are typically around 30-40lbs though individuals have been found to be as small as 25lbs and eastern populations tend to be much larger, upwards of 50lbs, due to early hybridization with wolves as they moved east. Eastern wolves have more variability in coat color and pattern, and tend to be more pack-oriented than desert dwelling populations. However, despite not being hybridized, Yellowstone coyotes also associate in small packs.</p>

                        <p> Wolves and coyotes do not get along, normally, and wolves are well known to kill coyotes. It is theorized that the reason why coyotes show more pack like behaviour than they did is because coyotes took the place of wolves, where wolves have been exterminated. The cooperation of the pack is needed to take down larger prey, such as deer, that the smaller canine is not well suited to take solo or in pairs, as is commonly seen hunting behaviour in the southwest while hunting hares and rodents.</p>

                        <h3 class="Info RecoveryEfforts">RecoveryEfforts</h3>

                        <p>None.</p>

                        <p>The coyote is often seen as a nuisance animal. They can be actively hunted at any time of year. Due to their adaptability, coyotes often live under the radar in human populated areas, preferring the cover of night to day. Urban populations tend to be very quiet, though you can often hear their yip-yowls in the evening.</p>

                        <p>Coyotes are seen as a threat to wolf recovery because of the fact that coyotes and wolves can interbreed. Thus there is no conservation interest to protect them, and coyote populations are stable.</p>

                        <p>The coyote is well known for its howl. However, unlike that of a wolf, their howl usually consists of a short series of yips and yells, instead of a long dipping note like the grey wolf.</p>

                        <p>
                            Coyote is often heralded as the trickster spirit who brought humankind fire by some Native American
                            tribes.
